# **Lab Report 5 - Done QuickER**
***

## Before the timer:

Have your ssh keys set up properly for both your ieng6 log in, and your github log in.

Have the following text in a .txt file right above your terminal:

But instead of my ssh link for lab7, have your own.

Lastly, have the `ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` as your most recent command in the terminal.

## Step 4: Logging into ieng6
Since we have our most recent command as the command we need to log into ieng6, we simply hit `<up>` and `<ENTER>` and we will be logged into ieng6.

## Steps 5-8: Cloning, Running and Editing in one go.

Using the .txt file above the terminal, if we copy lines 1-9 (yes, including the empty line) with `<CTRL-C>` and then paste it into our terminal with `<CTRL-V>`,
we will be able to clone the repository, `cd` into lab7, run the code to see that it failed, and we will end up in the nano interface ready to edit the file.

Once we are in the file, we hold `<down>` until we get to the last line that has `index1 += 1` and change it to `index2 += 1`.

Then we can input `<CTRL-X>` `<Y>` `<ENTER>` to save our changes, confirm the name, and exit the nano interface. 

Now, if we scroll up to confirm that the tests really did fail, we should be able to see that it looks like this:

Now we copy lines 5-7 of our .txt file and then press `<CTRL-V>`, we will be able to see that our changes now make the code pass its tests.

## Step 9: Commit and pushing the changes to Github.

Now if we copy lines 12-15 of our .txt file, we can get all the commands needed for this step in one fell swoop.

Simply copy the lines with `<CTRL-C>` then paste them into the terminal with `<CTRL-V>` and the output should look as follows:

And that's it!
